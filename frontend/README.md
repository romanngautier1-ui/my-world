# Frontend

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 21.1.2.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.

## Additional Resources

For more information on using the Angular CLI, including detailed command references, visit the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.dev/tools/cli) page.

## Run with Docker

To run a production build of the frontend inside a lightweight Nginx container (used by `docker-compose`):

```bash
# From repository root
docker-compose build frontend
docker-compose up -d frontend

- Nginx serves static assets; if you get `403` for font files (e.g. `plento.ttf`), ensure the `frontend/Dockerfile` sets readable permissions.

### Docker Prerequisites (local)

- Ensure you have Docker Desktop (macOS/Windows) or Colima installed and running locally, otherwise, the build and up commands will fail.
